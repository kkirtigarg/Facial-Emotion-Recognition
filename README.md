## Facial Emotion Recognition system using deep learning techniques:
The goal was to design a system that accurately recognizes and classifies facial expressions into 8 different categories. I gathered and preprocessed a diverse dataset of more than 10,000 facial images. Highlight the importance of diversity for model generalization. I performed tasks such as normalization, resizing, and augmentation to enhance the model's robustness. I designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction. I trained the model on the preprocessed dataset to learn and recognize patterns associated with facial expressions and used a separate validation set to ensure the model's performance generalizes well to new data. One challenge was ensuring the model's accuracy across diverse facial features and expressions. I addressed this by carefully curating a diverse dataset and fine-tuning the model accordingly.
